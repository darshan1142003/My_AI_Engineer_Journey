# My AI Engineer Journey

This repository contains my day-wise learning journey of becoming an AI Engineer.  
I am following a structured AI Engineer roadmap, starting from Python basics and gradually moving toward Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and real-world AI projects.

I am uploading my daily practice, notes, and projects here to track my progress, stay consistent, and build strong fundamentals through hands-on learning.

This repository includes Python programming, math for AI, data analysis, machine learning concepts, deep learning basics, and mini projects as per the roadmap.

The goal of this journey is to move from beginner to a confident AI Engineer through disciplined learning and practical implementation.
