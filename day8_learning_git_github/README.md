Day 8 – Git and GitHub Basics
AI Engineer Journey

What I Learned Today

Today I learned the basics of Git and GitHub. I understood how version control works and why it is important in real software projects. I practiced using Git from the command line and learned how developers track changes, save progress, and manage code professionally.

This day helped me understand how projects are maintained over time and how code history is preserved. Git is a very important skill for every fresher and software engineer.

Important Git Commands (Essential for Freshers)

git init
This command creates a new Git repository in the current folder.

git status
This command shows the current state of files, such as modified, new, or staged files.

git add .
This command adds all changed files to the staging area.
