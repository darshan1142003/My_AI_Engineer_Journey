Day 11 – Python API Practice

On Day 11, I learned how to use APIs in Python to fetch real-time data from the internet. I understood how GET requests work, how to use the requests library, and how to handle JSON responses.

I built a simple Weather App that fetches live weather data, displays temperature and wind speed, and saves the data into a file.

This day helped me understand how real applications work with external data and APIs, which is important for AI and backend development.
